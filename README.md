# known bugs
 - Non so far

# I learned that...?
 - I started this project with an "A calls B calls C etc" setup and later changed this to one with a central control.
 - This caused a heck of a lot to break and other then fixing the bugs I started streamlining the code a little as well.
 - Taking it from working but hard to read and inefficient to slightly less so cost me more time than i'd have liked and dont concider it to be totally worth the trouble.
 - Perhaps the person reading my code would disagree :)

# Achknowledgments
 - Wrote this with minimum help from the internet, other than the "The Odin Project" study material.
 - I used a set of a thousand words file from first20hours.com
